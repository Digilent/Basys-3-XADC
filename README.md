Basys 3 XADC  Demo
==============
 [Link to the project wiki](https://reference.digilentinc.com/learn/programmable-logic/tutorials/basys-3-xadc/start)
 
Introduction
--------------
This project is a Verilog demo using the Basys 3, switches, LEDs and seven-segment display. When programmed onto the board, voltage levels between 0 and 1 Volt are read off of the JXADC header. The 16 User LEDs increment from right to left as the voltage difference on the selected XADC pins gets larger. The two seven-segment displays show the voltage difference on the AD6, AD7, AD14, AD15 pins in volts. SW0 and SW1 select which XADC channel is displayed.

| Channel | SW0 position| SW1 position |
| ------- | ----------- | ------------ |
| XA1     |    Down     |  Down        |
| XA2     |    Up       |  Down        |
| XA3     |    Down     |  Up          |
| XA4     |    Up       |  Up          |



 
 Requirements
--------------
* **Basys 3**: To purchase a Basys 3, see the [Digilent Store](https://store.digilentinc.com/basys-3-artix-7-fpga-trainer-board-recommended-for-introductory-users/)
* **Vivado 2018.2 Installation**: To learn how to get Vivado, see the [Installing Vivado and Digilent Board Files Tutorial](https://reference.digilentinc.com/vivado/installing-vivado/start).
* **Serial Terminal Emulator**: For more information, see the [Installating and Using a Terminal Emulator Tutorial](https://reference.digilentinc.com/learn/programmable-logic/tutorials/tera-term).
* **MicroUSB Cable**
* **Wires and a voltage to measure**

Demo Setup
--------------
1. Download and extract the most recent release ZIP archive from this repository's [Releases Page](https://github.com/Digilent/Basys-3-XADC/releases).
2. Open the project in Vivado 2018.2 by double clicking on the included XPR file found at "\<archive extracted location\>/vivado_proj/Basys-3-XADC.xpr".
3. In the *Flow Navigator* panel on the left side of the Vivado window, click **Open Hardware Manager**.
4. Plug a Basys 3 into the computer running Vivado using a MicroUSB cable.
5. Open a serial terminal emulator (such as TeraTerm) and connect it to the Basys 3's serial port, using a baud rate of 9600.
6. Click "Open target" in the green bar at the top of the window. Select "Auto connect" from the drop down menu.
7. Click "Program device" in the green bar at the top of the window. In the "Program Device" Wizard, enter "\<archive extracted location\>vivado_proj/Basys-3-XADC.runs/impl_1/top.bit" into the "Bitstream file" field. Then click **Program**.
8. The demo will now be programmed onto the Basys 3. See the *Introduction* section of this README for a description of how this demo works.


Next Steps
--------------
This demo can be used as a basis for other projects, either by adding sources included in the demo's release to those projects, or by modifying the sources in the release project. Check out the Basys 3's [Resource Center](https://reference.digilentinc.com/reference/programmable-logic/basys-3/start?redirect=1) to find more documentation, demos, and tutorials.
